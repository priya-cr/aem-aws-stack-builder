Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

* __Q:__ Why doesn't Stack Builder create and manage each S3 bucket required for storing stack state?<br/>
  __A:__ This is due to [S3 bucket names being globally unique](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html). Stack Builder doesn't attempt to create the S3 bucket dynamically due to the risk of the bucket name being unavailable because it's already used by another AWS account. You could argue that the probability is very low, but this is not something that needs to be risked, specially for a more conservative environment where an unintentional failure can trigger a lot of red tape processes.

* __Q:__ How to solve timeout error when deploying a large AEM package?<br/>
  __A:__ You need to increase the value of `aem.deployment_delay_in_seconds`, `aem.deployment_check_retries`, and `aem.deployment_check_delay_in_seconds` [configuration properties](https://github.com/shinesolutions/aem-aws-stack-builder/blob/master/docs/configuration.md). Depending on the content of the AEM package, you might also need to increase the instance type via `<component>.instance_type` .

* __Q:__ How to set up custom AWS tags?<br/>
  __A:__ This can be [configured](https://github.com/shinesolutions/aem-aws-stack-builder/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#aws-configuration-properties) in `aws.tags` property. For example:
  ```
  aws:
    tags:
    - Key: Project
      Value: Open Source AEM Platform
    - Key: Owner
      Value: Shine Solutions AEM Team
    - Key: Cost Centre
      Value: 12345
  ```

* __Q:__ How to check if the component provisioning has been completed successfully?<br/>
  __A:__ Please follow this [AEM Environment Provisioning Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/shinesolutions/aem-aws-stack-builder/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting-guide.md#aem-environment-provisioning).


* __Q:__ Why is the stack provisioning failing with the error message `unexpected response code` ?<br/>
  __A:__ This may happen as some Bundles e.g. `Adobe Granite CRX Package Manager` are starting some `Declarative Service Components`. Since it may take a while until all `Declarative Service Components` are started. Though the AEM Healthcheck is showing all bundles are up and running. To give AEM more time after starting the service set the option `aem.enable_post_start_sleep` to true and modify the wait time `aem.post_start_sleep_seconds`to your own needs.
  
 * __Q:__ Why does create stack manager build fail with error `Export with name abc-InstanceProfilesStackName is already exported by stack abc-aem-consolidated-prerequisites-stack` ?<br/>
  __A:__ This happens when we give same prefix name while creating prerequisite/main stack and stack manager. It is important to give different prefix while creating stack manager
